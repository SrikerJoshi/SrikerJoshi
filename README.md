# üìÇ [AI-Based LLM chatbots](https://github.com/SrikerJoshi/Projects/tree/main/AI%20based%20LLM%20Chatbots) <a name="AI-based LLM Chatbots"></a> 

- Want to chat with my chatbot? [![Chatbot Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Chatbot-Streamlit-green?style=flat&logo=streamlit&logoColor=white&logoSize=50)](https://sriker-chatbot.streamlit.app/)

## **Description:**
This project attempts to build AI-based chatbots to use custom data as context for various LLMs for building your chatbot, Here I have shown examples of building chatbots that help users know more about my resume.

**Main Features:**
- Feature 1: It is straightforward to understand.
- Feature 2: You can run these on your local machine or kaggle.
- Feature 3: I did not include API keys for all the LLM services but I have included how you can make the Chatbot run on your local system or on Kaggle without much hassle.
- Feature 4: These models are just for simply trying out building your custom chatbots, These are command line bots and do not have an interface but they can be easily built using Streamlit which is shown in the implementation of one of the chatbots.

**LLMs Used:**  
- Google Gemini  
- Open AI  
- OLLAMA
  
**Other tools:**
- Streamlit

# üìÇ [Deep learning projects](https://github.com/SrikerJoshi/Projects/tree/main/Deep%20learning%20projects) <a name="Deep learning projects"></a> 
## **Description:**  
These projects attempt to showcase various Deep learning concepts to do classification tasks on the CIFAR-10 dataset and I have shown how various models are better at doing various tasks when it comes to models when performing certain tasks, here I have considered classification as my primary task and used various methods to optimize the model to train better on the dataset to be able to classify the CIFAR-10 dataset. You can find what are the optimization techniques I have used along with detailed reports encompassing my approach. There is also a Custom CNN I have built to train the model to do Blood cell classification as well.

**Main Features:**
- Feature 1: It is straightforward to understand and detailed reports explain what happened while I was working on each model.
- Feature 2: You can run these on your local machine or Kaggle, I have included the HTML pages to be able to see how the code performed.
- Feature 3: These are just touching the surface of deep learning and you can find so many more projects like these on kaggle.

**Models Used:**  
- liner classifier 
- 2 - layer neural network  
- CNN
- KNN
- Custom CNN

# üìÇ [Machine learning concepts](https://github.com/SrikerJoshi/Projects/tree/main/Machine%20learning%20concepts) <a name="Machine learning concepts"></a> 
## **Description:**  
These projects attempt to showcase various Machine learning concepts and models to help learn the basics of machine learning and these were taught to me at my university, this also has a concept called Newton's Method (or Newton-Raphson method) in machine learning which is useful to minimize or maximize the loss function while training a machine learning model. You can see the implementation of Newton's Method for Wisconsin breast cancer data which leads to the implementation of a logistic regression classifier that closely matches the scikit-learn model's performance.

**Main Features:**
- Feature 1: It is straightforward to understand and detailed reports explain what happened while I was working on each model.
- Feature 2: You can run these on your local machine and I have included the HTML pages to be able to see how the code performed.
- Feature 3: These are just touching the surface of machine learning and you can find so many more projects like these on Kaggle.

**Models Used:**  
- liner classifier 
- Newton's method 
- Scikit learn

# üìÇ [An improvised mobile search engine](https://github.com/SrikerJoshi/Projects/tree/main/Improvised%20mobile%20search%20engine) <a name="An improvised mobile search engine"></a> 
## **Description:**  
This project attempts to build a spatial inverted index-based search engine for identifying nearby locations serving specific dishes based on keywords.

**Main Features:**
- Feature 1: It is a full project (end-end)  with a detailed project report.
- Feature 2: You can run these on your local machine or kaggle.
